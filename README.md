The 'Members Only' application is a project for The Odin Project ruby on rails path. I built this application using Rails 7 and the devise gem. The application is good practice for authentication and allows users to view/creates posts. If a user is not signed in, they can view a post, but cannot see its author. If a user is signed in, they can view posts and their authors, and create posts. All users can sign up, log in, log out, and perform the generic user actions with devise e.g., password reset, change password etc.

While using CSS frameworks in rails is a convenient way to style an app, I chose to use vanilla CSS to style this app, mainly using flexbox to organise elements. The reason for this was to make an app that did not look like all the others submitted by students, and to keep my CSS skills sharpened. I am happy with the way it looks.
